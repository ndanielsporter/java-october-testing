//		Clinic Project
//
//		Let's continue on our health clinic sim.  We'll start small, and then feel free to
//		expand as your imagination brings in new ideas!
//
//		Make a ClinicDriver class - has the main method where we'll execute the sim.
//		Use our Patient class - a patient has a name, height, weight, blood type,
//		and boolean isSick.  Add more attributes in addition if you like.  Your patients needs
//		an overloaded constructor and no parameter constructor.  Make getters and setters.
//
//		Make a HealthWorker class - health worker can have a name.  Add any attributes in
//		addition, but for basic set up we don't need a lot.  Your health worker needs
//		2 methods minimum - runTests(...you can put inputs here if you want or not), and 
//		treatSick(also put in here what you want).  You can make the return types
//		void and simply print some text.  Or you can make the methods take a Patient object
//		into the parameters, i.e. treatSick(Patient patient) and have the return type
//		be a Patient, ie 'public Patient treatSick(Patient patient)', and the methods
//		toggle the Patient class 'isSick' boolean!  - that is bonus and a hint.
//
//		Then back in our main() of ClinicDriver, we need to make an array of Patients
//		that we will call - Patient[] waitingRoomPatients;  Make it size 12.
//		You need to make a loop or some way to now plug in Patients into that array.
//
//		Make patient at index 7 and 11 sick.  You can also randomize this if you know
//		how.
//
//		Loop through the Patient[], and have a HealthWorker object treat your patients!
//		Make them at a minimum run tests for every patient, and if they are sick, let's
//		use our method to make them feel better!
//
//		The above is an outline with some definitely defined ideas to get started.
//		Be creative with this and feel free to tweak your program to be your own!
//		Make sure you know how to achieve the above functionality at a minimum.
//
//		Good luck and happy coding! :)

		// Patient array for patients in waiting room
		Patient[] waitingRoomPatients = new Patient[12];
		
		// loop array to add patients
		int count = 0;
