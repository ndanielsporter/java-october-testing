//	The Burger Joint
//	In this project we are going to make a small simulation of a burger stand.
//	For the basic / minimum requirements we'll keep it simple, but at the bottom of the
//	write up we'll list some bonus things you can include.
//	We need 3 things minimum to make our Burger Joint work.
//	The Cook - the cook can do everything - make burgers, clean the stand, take orders,
//	    and be a cashier.
//	Our Burger - we can build a basic burger (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, the meat, buns)
//	    hint, hint (building a burger...)  we have options to build burgers with different
//	    toppings. i.e. No tomato, etc.
//	Our Restaurant / Burger Stand - maybe this class can have the main method?  then 
//	     we have our cook that makes burgers in here.
//	     
//	Minimum requirements - try to work on making these three classes and having them
//	interact with one another.  Have your Cook have a function to makeBurger();
//	Bonus:
//	Have a customer class and cashier class
//	    cashier places orders from customers and the cook makes the burgers
//	Incorporate a loop to serve many customers in the restaurant or in line for
//	    our burger stand
